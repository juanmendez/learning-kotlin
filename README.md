# Learning Kotlin

Try to learn Kotlin in a weekend, and you can easily forget it. But if it is done in a consistent learning manner daily then you can not just learn it but retain it.

This is a demo broken by different subjects and stored in different branches. Rather than using a static main method, it uses tests both done in Kotlin and Java. Some of the tests are pretty obvious but the idea is to run the functionality more likely. These are my own demos, but if you want to learn it here is a great tutorial by Kevin Jones [Kotlin Fundamentals](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/kotlin-fundamentals/table-of-contents)

These demos are done targetting not Android Studio but IntellJ. So run them there instead. I like sometimes to stay away from Android Studio like I've done also with Dagger

I write several apps and demos in Github, part of the reason is to have some reference for future projects, but also to help others who are constantly learning like me.
